# Mistakes & Learnings

Every real mistake made while building CKAuth, grouped by topic, with the rule it taught us. For the timeline, see [DEVLOG.md](DEVLOG.md); for unfamiliar terms, see the [glossary](docs/GLOSSARY.md).

**How to read an entry:**

- **What went wrong:** the mistake, and why it mattered.
- **→ Fix:** what we changed. Codes like `ca53b11` are the commits.
- **Rule:** the habit that stops it from happening again. The rules are the part worth remembering.

---

## Passwords

- **Hand-rolled password hashing.** Passwords were hashed with HMAC-SHA256 plus a salt (`19553f4`). SHA-256 is built to be *fast*, so anyone holding a leaked database could test billions of guesses per second.
  → Switched to bcrypt, which is slow on purpose (`ca53b11`).
  **Rule:** hash passwords with a deliberately slow function (bcrypt or argon2), never a general-purpose hash.
- **Logged the raw password.** Sign-up ran `console.log("password", password, ...)` (`19553f4`). Logs get copied, stored and read by many people, so a password in a log is a leaked password.
  → Removed.
  **Rule:** never log passwords, tokens, secrets or full request bodies on auth routes.

## Tokens & sessions

- **Refresh tokens stored as plain text** (`95f7b62`). A database leak would have handed out working sessions.
  → Stored as SHA-256 hashes (`5c4c505`).
  **Rule:** store every long-lived token hashed (refresh, reset, verification), just like passwords. SHA-256 is fine here, unlike for passwords, because these tokens are long and random, so there's nothing to guess.
- **Unsafe cookie settings** (`95f7b62`). `SameSite` decides whether the browser sends a cookie when *another* site triggers the request:
  - Sign-in wrote its cookie options inline (`SameSite=None`, `Secure` always on) and ignored the shared `cookieOptions`.
  - `SameSite=None` sends cookies on every cross-site request, which invites CSRF (a malicious site making your browser act on another site where you're signed in).
  - The unused `cookieOptions` paired `None` with `Secure` off in development, a combination browsers reject.

  → One shared `cookieOptions`, with `SameSite=Lax`, `Secure` in production, and the expiry taken from the token (`ca53b11`).
  **Rule:** define cookie options in one place. Default to `httpOnly` + `SameSite=Lax` + `Secure` in production. Use `None` only for genuine cross-site setups, and only together with `Secure`.

## Account enumeration (revealing who has an account)

- **Sign-in revealed which emails exist.** It returned 404 for an unknown user and 403 for a wrong password (`2623376`), so anyone could test an email list against it.
  → One `401 "Invalid email or password"` for both.
- **Sign-up revealed which emails exist.** It returned `409 "email already exists"`, plus the new user's `id` when it succeeded.
  → Always `201 "check your email"`; the real owner learns the difference by email (`83025f2`).

  **Rule:** every auth endpoint answers the same way whether or not the account exists: same status, same body, similar response time. Explain differences by email, where only the inbox owner can read them.

## Email verification

- **The verification link didn't match its route** (`09f6ed8`, `c50d2fb`):
  - The email linked to `GET /auth/verify-email?token=` on the API, but the route was `POST /verify-email/:token`.
  - The route also required the user to be signed in already, which they can't be before verifying.

  → The link now opens a frontend page, which sends the token to the API; no sign-in needed.
  **Rule:** test every email link end to end. Links should open a page, never perform an action on a plain GET, because email scanners open links automatically and would use up the token.
- **A failed email failed the request.** Sign-up and sign-in waited for the email to send (`09f6ed8`), so a Resend outage meant nobody could sign up.
  → Emails are now fire-and-forget (sent in the background, with errors logged instead of returned), and the user can ask for a new link.
  **Rule:** a side effect can run fire-and-forget only if it can be retried, and the response must not depend on it.
- **Sign-in sent a verification email every time** an unverified user tried to sign in.
  → Only when the last link has expired, checked and updated in one database statement.
- **Pre-account takeover.** An attacker could sign up with someone else's email and their own password. When the real owner clicked the verification link, the account was verified *with the attacker's password*.
  → Sign-in requires a verified email, verifying requires the sign-up password, and verifying signs out earlier sessions (`83025f2`).
  **Rule:** a verified email proves who owns the inbox, not who chose the password. Fix this before adding "Sign in with Google" or any login that links accounts by email.

## Concurrency (requests arriving at the same time)

- **Check, then insert.** "Look up the email, then insert if it isn't there" is the *check-then-act* pattern: two simultaneous requests can both pass the check and both insert, a race condition.
  → `onConflictDoNothing` on the unique email column (`ca53b11`).
- **Rate-limiting emails.** "Read when the last email was sent, then send" lets simultaneous requests both send.
  → One conditional update, `UPDATE … WHERE expired … RETURNING`, which changes the row only if the condition still holds and returns it if it did. Only the request that gets a row back sends.
- **Replacing avatars.** Two uploads at once could both read the same old file, leaving one orphaned file behind.
  → Lock the user's row (`SELECT … FOR UPDATE`, which makes other requests wait) in a transaction (a group of changes that succeed or fail together), and only after the ImageKit upload has finished.

  **Rule:** let the database decide races, with unique constraints, conditional updates and row locks, never with "check, then act" in app code. Keep slow network calls outside transactions, so locks are held briefly.

## File uploads

- **Trusting the client.** The browser-reported file type and extension can be anything.
  → Check the real type from the file's first bytes, reject before saving, and check the session before reading the file at all.
- **User IDs in public URLs.** Avatar filenames were `<userId>.png`, which exposed internal IDs through public image URLs.
  → Random UUID filenames, with a `user:<id>` tag for searching in ImageKit's dashboard.
- **Orphaned files.** Every failure path must clean up files already uploaded to cloud storage: delete the new file if saving to the database fails, and delete the old one after a successful switch.

## Config & tooling

- **`.env.sample` was ignored by git.** The `.env.*` pattern caught the template file too.
  → Added `!.env.sample`.
  **Rule:** after adding an ignore pattern, check it with `git check-ignore -v <file>`.
- **A real value in the sample file.** The production sender address was in `.env.sample`.
  → Replaced with placeholders.
- **Migration generated but not applied.** The code expected columns the database didn't have yet.
  → Running `pnpm db:migrate` is part of "done".
- **A typo in a route handler reached a commit** (`36e8342`).
  **Rule:** run `pnpm build` (the type check) before every commit.
- **The backend `tsconfig` compiled the frontend.** With no `include`, TypeScript picked up `frontend/**` as well.
  → Added `"include": ["src"]`.
  **Rule:** when one package sits inside another, the outer package's `tsconfig` must list what it compiles.
- **The frontend built locally but failed in CI.** `vite.config.ts` uses `process.env`, but only the root (API) package depended on `@types/node`. On the laptop, TypeScript found it in `../node_modules`; CI installs `frontend/` on its own, so it wasn't there.
  → Added `@types/node` to `frontend/package.json`.
  **Rule:** a nested package must declare every dependency itself. Check with a clean copy (`git archive`) that installs only that package, as CI does.
- **The first VPS script would have locked out the admin.** It turned off root SSH, but the only remaining user (`deploy`) had no `sudo`, so nobody could have administered the server.
  → A separate `chirag` admin user with `sudo`; `deploy` is for CI only.
  **Rule:** before turning off a way in, make sure another way in with the same powers exists, and test it from a new terminal.
- **SSH password logins stayed on after hardening.** The script wrote `PasswordAuthentication no` to `sshd_config.d/99-hardening.conf`, but `sshd` keeps the *first* value it reads, and Hostinger's `50-cloud-init.conf` loads earlier with `yes`. The server kept accepting passwords for `chirag`. It only came to light when a failed key login fell back to a password prompt.
  → Renamed the file to `00-hardening.conf`. The script now checks the settings actually in force (`sshd -T`) and fails if they're wrong.
  **Rule:** for `sshd`, unlike most programs, the first value wins, so settings that must win go in a file that loads first (`00-`). Verify the settings in force (`sshd -T`, or the login methods `ssh -v` reports), not just the file you wrote.
- **Piping data into `ssh host "sudo …"` can't work.** Without a terminal, `sudo` can't ask for the password; with `-t`, it reads the piped data *as* the password.
  → Put the data in the command itself (`ssh -t vps "echo '$(cat key.pub)' | sudo tee -a …"`), leaving the keyboard free for the password prompt.
  **Rule:** a remote `sudo` that may ask for a password gets `ssh -t` and nothing piped into it.
- **The edge proxy ignored `ACME_EMAIL`.** The docs said to put it in `/opt/edge/.env`, but Docker Compose only uses `.env` to fill `${...}` placeholders in `compose.yml`. Nothing passed the value into the container, so Caddy used its default address.
  → `environment: ACME_EMAIL: ${ACME_EMAIL:-…}` in `deploy/edge/compose.yml`.
  **Rule:** a value in a Compose `.env` file reaches a container only through `environment:` or `env_file:`. Check with `docker compose exec <service> env`.
- **The web container never started in production.** The official `caddy` binary carries a file capability (`cap_net_bind_service`, a piece of root's power attached to the program file). With `cap_drop: [ALL]` and `no-new-privileges`, the kernel refuses to run it, so the container looped on `exec /usr/bin/caddy: operation not permitted` and failed its health check on the first deploy. Its tmpfs mounts (in-memory scratch folders) were also owned by root, so Caddy (running as user 65534) couldn't write to them.
  → `RUN setcap -r /usr/bin/caddy` in `frontend/Dockerfile` (port 8080 needs no capability), and `uid=65534,gid=65534` on the tmpfs mounts.
  **Rule:** run an image once with its production `cap_drop`, `user` and `read_only` settings before the first deploy, and check the main program of any image you drop capabilities from with `getcap`.

## Performance

- **Password hashing on the main thread capped the whole API.** `bcryptjs` is pure JavaScript, so each ~60 ms hash ran on Node's only JavaScript thread, the event loop, and blocked it. Sign-in topped out at 17 per second, and a burst of sign-ins delayed every other request.
  → Native `bcrypt`, which hashes on libuv's thread pool (Node's background worker threads).
  **Rule:** CPU-heavy work (hashing, image processing, compression) must run off the main thread: a native or async implementation that uses the thread pool, or a worker.
- **"Zero errors" hid a collapse.** At 2,000 people online every request still succeeded, but the p95 (the time within which 95% of requests finished) was 12 seconds: demand outran capacity, and the queue kept growing.
  → Judge load tests by p95/p99 response times, not by error rate.
  **Rule:** a load test passes on latency targets, not on success counts.
- **A smaller thread pool made things worse.** Limiting `UV_THREADPOOL_SIZE` (the number of libuv threads) to 1, to keep bcrypt to one core, slowed real users (p50 1.56 s vs 0.73 s), because database reconnects also look up hostnames on that pool.
  → Kept the default of 4.
  **Rule:** measure a tuning change before keeping it. The thread pool is shared by DNS lookups, file access and crypto.
- **A load test with fake emails missed both the cost and a leak.** Bots using made-up emails never reached bcrypt, because unknown emails returned early. That made the attack look cheap, and hid a timing difference (16 ms vs 60 ms) that revealed which emails had accounts.
  → Reran the test against real accounts.
  **Rule:** attack simulations must use realistic inputs (real usernames for credential stuffing, the attack that replays email/password pairs leaked from other sites). Response *time* must not depend on whether an account exists.
- **Default keep-alive timeouts would have caused random 502s.** Keep-alive reuses one connection for many requests. Node closes idle connections after 5 s, while Caddy reuses upstream sockets (its connections to the app) for much longer, so a POST could land on a socket Node had just closed.
  → `keepAliveTimeout` of 125 s in Node; Caddy closes idle connections after 60 s.
  **Rule:** behind a proxy, the app's idle timeout must be longer than the proxy's.

## SEO

- **The SPA fallback answered 200 for every address.** A single-page app needs unknown paths to load `index.html`, so the router in the browser can draw them. But `try_files {path} /index.html` meant `/robots.txt`, `/sitemap.xml` and every misspelled URL returned the app with status 200. Search engines count those as "soft 404s", and the site had no way to say "this page doesn't exist".
  → List the app's routes in the Caddyfile and serve the app shell for them; everything else gets a real 404 that still shows the 404 page.
  **Rule:** a catch-all fallback must still return 404 for addresses the app doesn't know. Check with `curl -I` on a made-up URL.
- **A page drawn by JavaScript looks empty to most crawlers.** Only Google runs the JavaScript, and later than the rest; link previews never do.
  → Prerender the public page (render it to HTML at build time) and hydrate it (React takes over the finished HTML in the browser).
  **Rule:** anything meant to be found or shared (content, title, meta description, Open Graph tags, which control link previews) must be in the HTML the server sends. Check with `curl`, not in the browser.

## Process

- Commit messages for behaviour or security changes need a body explaining *why*, plus a `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer when the API changes. One-line messages are only for trivial commits.
- After a change, test the real flow end to end against the database and the external services, not just a successful build.
