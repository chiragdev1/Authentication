## Web basics

**API (Application Programming Interface).** A set of addresses a program can call to ask a server to do something. CKAuth's API lives under `/auth`, for example `POST /auth/sign-in`.

**Endpoint.** One address in an API, together with its HTTP method: `GET /auth/me` and `POST /auth/logout` are two endpoints.

**HTTP method.** The verb of a request. `GET` reads something; `POST` creates something or performs an action.

**Status code.** The three-digit number a server returns with every response:

| Code | Meaning | Example in CKAuth |
|---|---|---|
| 200 | OK | Signed in |
| 201 | Created | Sign-up accepted |
| 308 | Permanent redirect | `http://` sent to `https://` |
| 400 | Bad request (invalid input) | A malformed email address |
| 401 | Unauthorized: we don't know who you are | Missing or expired session |
| 403 | Forbidden: we know who you are, but you may not do this | Email not verified yet |
| 404 | Not found | A page that doesn't exist |
| 409 | Conflict | Not used: sign-up never reveals an existing account |
| 413 | Payload too large | An avatar over 2 MB |
| 429 | Too many requests | Rate limit reached |
| 500 | Server error | A bug |
| 502 | Bad gateway: the proxy couldn't reach the app | The API container is down |

**Header.** Extra information sent with a request or response, as `Name: value` lines. Security settings such as CSP are headers.

**JSON.** A text format for data, such as `{"email": "ada@example.com"}`. CKAuth's requests and responses are JSON.

**Cookie.** A small piece of data the server asks the browser to store and send back with later requests. CKAuth keeps its session tokens in cookies.

**httpOnly cookie.** A cookie that JavaScript on the page cannot read. If an attacker manages to run a script on the page, they still can't steal the session.

**SameSite.** A cookie setting that controls whether the browser sends the cookie when another site makes the request. `Lax` (CKAuth's setting) blocks most cross-site uses, which protects against CSRF.

**Origin.** The scheme, domain and port of a URL, such as `https://ckauth.chiragdev.com`. Two URLs with the same origin are "same-origin".

**CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing).** Rules that let a page on one origin call an API on another. CKAuth doesn't need CORS, because the web app and the API share one origin.

**HTTPS / TLS.** Encrypted HTTP. TLS is the encryption protocol, and a certificate proves the server owns its domain.

**Proxy / reverse proxy.** A server that sits in front of other servers and forwards requests to them. CKAuth uses Caddy as its reverse proxy.

**Upstream.** From a proxy's point of view, the app it forwards requests to. Caddy's *upstream sockets* are its connections to the API.

**`X-Forwarded-For`.** A header a proxy adds to say which IP the request originally came from. Express reads it when `trust proxy` is on.

---

## Sign-in and security

**Authentication.** Proving *who* someone is, for example with an email and password. Failure is a `401`.

**Authorization.** Deciding *what* that person may do. Failure is a `403`.

**Session.** The period during which a user stays signed in without re-entering their password.

**JWT (JSON Web Token).** A signed token that carries facts such as a user ID. The server can check the signature, so it can tell if anyone changed the token.

**Claim.** One fact stored inside a JWT, such as the user ID (`sub`), the expiry time (`exp`) or a unique token ID (`jti`).

**Access token.** A short-lived JWT (about 15 minutes) sent with each request to prove who the user is.

**Refresh token.** A longer-lived token whose only job is to get a new access token when the old one expires.

**Token rotation.** Replacing the refresh token every time it's used. A stolen token stops working after one use.

**Hash.** A one-way scramble of data: you can check a value against its hash, but you can't recover the value from it. CKAuth stores only hashes of passwords and tokens.

**bcrypt.** A password-hashing function that is deliberately slow, so an attacker with a leaked hash can try far fewer guesses per second. `bcrypt` is the fast native version; `bcryptjs` is pure JavaScript and blocks the server while it runs.

**SHA-256.** A fast hash function. It's fine for long random tokens, but unsafe for passwords, because people choose guessable passwords.

**HMAC.** A hash mixed with a secret key, used to prove a message wasn't changed. It's too fast to be safe for passwords.

**Salt.** Random data added to a password before hashing, so that two equal passwords get different hashes. bcrypt adds its own salt.

**Account enumeration.** Finding out which emails have accounts by watching how the app responds. CKAuth gives the same answer whether or not an account exists.

**Timing attack / timing leak.** Learning a secret from how *long* a response takes. CKAuth's sign-in once answered faster for unknown emails, which gave away who was registered.

**Pre-account takeover.** An attacker signs up with someone else's email before the real owner does, and keeps access afterwards. CKAuth blocks it by asking for the sign-up password when the email is verified.

**Rate limiting.** Capping how many requests one IP address, email or user can make in a time window. Over the limit, the answer is `429`.

**Credential stuffing.** An attack that tries email/password pairs leaked from *other* sites.

**Fail open / fail closed.** What a safety check does when it breaks: *fail open* lets requests through, *fail closed* blocks them. CKAuth's rate limits fail open, so a Redis outage doesn't lock everyone out.

**Botnet.** Many hijacked computers that attack together, from many IP addresses.

**CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery).** A malicious site making your browser send requests to another site where you're signed in. `SameSite` cookies prevent most of it.

**CSP (Content Security Policy).** A header that tells the browser which scripts, styles and images it may load. CKAuth's CSP blocks inline scripts, except the one theme script it names by **hash**: a fingerprint of the script's exact text (`'sha256-…'`), so changing even one character blocks it until the hash is updated.

**HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security).** A header that tells the browser to always use HTTPS for the site.

**Magic bytes.** The first bytes of a file, which reveal its real type (a PNG always starts with the same bytes). CKAuth trusts these, not the file name or the type the browser claims.

**TOTP.** The six-digit codes from an authenticator app, used for two-factor sign-in.

**Passkey (WebAuthn).** Signing in with the device's fingerprint, face or PIN instead of a password. Passkeys resist phishing.

**OpenID Connect (OIDC) / PKCE.** The standard protocol behind "Sign in with Google". PKCE is the part that protects the exchange in browser and mobile apps.

---

## Database

**PostgreSQL (Postgres).** The database CKAuth stores its users in.

**ORM.** A library that lets code work with database tables as objects. CKAuth uses **Drizzle**.

**Schema.** The definition of the tables and columns (`src/db/schema.ts`).

**Migration.** A file of SQL that changes the schema from one version to the next. Migrations are applied in order and never edited after release.

**Transaction.** A group of database changes that succeed or fail together.

**Unique constraint.** A database rule that a column can't hold the same value twice, such as two accounts with one email.

**Race condition.** A bug that appears only when two requests arrive at almost the same moment and interfere with each other.

**Check-then-act.** Reading a value, then deciding what to write based on it. Between the read and the write, another request can change the value, so this pattern causes race conditions.

**Conditional UPDATE.** An `UPDATE … WHERE …` that changes a row only if a condition still holds, and reports whether it did. The database itself decides which request wins.

**Row lock (`SELECT … FOR UPDATE`).** Locking a row inside a transaction, so other requests wait until you're done with it.

**`onConflictDoNothing`.** Drizzle's way of saying "insert this row, but if it breaks a unique constraint, skip it quietly".

---

## Server and performance

**Node.js.** The JavaScript runtime the API runs on.

**Main thread / event loop.** Node runs your JavaScript on one thread. Anything slow on that thread, like a long calculation, makes every other request wait.

**Thread pool (libuv).** A few background threads Node uses for slow work such as file access, DNS lookups and native bcrypt. Work there doesn't block the main thread.

**Express / middleware.** Express is the web framework. Middleware is a function that runs before a route's handler, for example to check the session (`authenticateToken`) or apply a rate limit.

**Zod.** A library that checks incoming data against a schema and rejects anything that doesn't fit.

**Fire-and-forget.** Starting a task, such as sending an email, without waiting for it to finish. Errors are logged rather than returned to the user.

**Single-flight.** When several callers need the same thing at once, only one request is made and they all share its result. CKAuth's web app refreshes the session this way.

**Stub.** A fake stand-in for a real service in a test, such as an email sender that accepts mail but never sends it.

**Redis.** A fast in-memory data store. CKAuth uses it to count requests for rate limiting.

**Keep-alive.** Reusing one network connection for several requests. Both sides have an idle timeout, and they must agree on it, or one side may send a request on a connection the other has just closed.

**Load test.** Simulating many users at once to find where the system slows down or breaks.

**p50 / p95 / p99.** Percentiles of response time. A p95 of 100 ms means 95% of requests finished within 100 ms. Averages hide slow outliers; percentiles show them.

**Throughput.** Requests handled per second.

**vCPU / core.** A unit of processing power. CKAuth's VPS has two.

---

## Frontend

**React.** The JavaScript library the web app is built with.

**SPA (single-page application).** A site where JavaScript draws every page in the browser instead of loading new HTML from the server.

**Vite.** The tool that runs the frontend in development and builds it for production.

**Tailwind CSS / shadcn/ui / Radix.** Tailwind styles elements with utility classes. shadcn/ui gives ready-made components we copy into the repo, built on Radix's accessible building blocks.

**Bundle.** The JavaScript files the build produces. Smaller bundles load faster.

**Code-splitting / lazy loading.** Splitting the bundle so each page's code downloads only when that page is opened.

**Render-blocking request.** A file (usually CSS or a script in `<head>`) the browser must download before it draws anything. Each one adds a network round trip before the first paint; inlining a small one into the HTML removes it.

**Prerendering.** Turning a page into finished HTML at build time. Visitors and crawlers then get the content without running JavaScript first.

**Hydration.** React taking over prerendered HTML in the browser and making it interactive. The browser's first render must match the HTML exactly, or React reports a *hydration mismatch*.

**Design lab.** CKAuth's development-only switcher for comparing candidate designs on the real pages (`frontend/src/lib/design-lab.tsx`).

---

## Hosting and deployment

**VPS (Virtual Private Server).** A rented virtual machine. CKAuth runs on a Hostinger KVM 2 with 2 vCPUs.

**Docker / image / container.** An *image* packages an app with everything it needs to run, and a *container* is a running copy of an image. Docker builds and runs them.

**Docker Compose.** A file (`compose.yml`) that describes several containers and how they connect, so one command starts them all.

**Caddy.** The web server and reverse proxy in front of CKAuth. It gets HTTPS certificates automatically.

**Edge proxy.** The one shared Caddy that receives all traffic on ports 80 and 443 for every site on the VPS, and passes each request to the right project.

**DNS.** The internet's address book, which maps names to IP addresses. Record types used here:

| Record | Holds |
|---|---|
| A / AAAA | The IPv4 / IPv6 address |
| TXT | Free text, used for verification and email rules |
| MX | Where to deliver email |
| CAA | Which certificate authorities may issue certificates for the domain |

**Let's Encrypt / ACME.** A free certificate authority, and the protocol Caddy uses to get certificates from it.

**SSH / SSH key.** SSH gives secure remote access to a server. An SSH key is a key pair: the private half stays on your machine, and the public half goes on the server.

**root / sudo.** `root` is the all-powerful Linux user. `sudo` lets an ordinary user run a single command as root.

**Linux capabilities.** Small pieces of root's power, such as "bind to ports below 1024". CKAuth's containers drop all of them (`cap_drop: ALL`).

**File capability.** A Linux capability attached to a program file, which the program gains when it starts. Containers that drop all capabilities refuse to start such programs, which is why the web image removes Caddy's.

**Network alias.** An extra name a container answers to on a Docker network. CKAuth uses `ckauth-api` and `ckauth-web`, so the shared edge proxy can reach them without clashing with other projects.

**setgid folder.** A folder where new files automatically belong to the folder's group, so several users can share it.

**tmpfs.** A folder that lives only in memory. It's used for scratch files in containers that are otherwise read-only.

**CI/CD.** Continuous integration (automatic checks on every change) and continuous deployment (shipping it automatically). CKAuth uses **GitHub Actions**, and stores images in **GHCR**, GitHub's container registry.

**Commit SHA.** The unique ID of a git commit. Images are tagged with it, so any version can be redeployed.

**Health check.** A regular request that confirms a container is working.

**Smoke test.** A quick check after a deploy that the main pages answer.

**Rollback.** Going back to the previous version after a bad deploy.

**Breaking change.** A change that existing clients must adapt to, or they stop working. In commit messages it's marked with a `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer.

**Environment variable.** A setting passed to the app from outside the code, such as `RESEND_API_KEY`.

---

## Logs and monitoring

**Observability.** Being able to tell what a running system is doing, and why, from what it records: logs, metrics and alerts.

**Structured log.** A log entry written as one JSON object, such as `{"event":"signin_failed","ip":"1.2.3.4"}`, instead of free text, so tools can filter, count and alert on it. **pino** is a fast structured logger for Node; its `redact` option removes fields like `password` before anything is written.

**Audit log.** A permanent record of security-relevant actions (sign-ins, password resets, sessions ended), answering "what happened to this account?" Ordinary logs answer "is the server healthy?"

**Request ID.** A unique ID given to each request and included in every log line it produces, so all the lines for one request can be found together.

**Log rotation.** Capping how large logs grow by starting a new file at a size limit and deleting the oldest. Without it, logs eventually fill the disk.

**Retention.** How long logs or metrics are kept before being deleted.

**Metrics.** Numbers measured over time, such as requests per second, error rate or sign-ins per hour. **Prometheus** is the usual tool for storing them.

**Grafana / Loki / Alloy.** Grafana draws dashboards and sends alerts; Loki stores and searches logs; Alloy is the agent that collects logs and metrics and sends them on. **Grafana Cloud** runs all of them as a hosted service.

**Uptime monitor.** A service that requests the site every minute or so and alerts you when it stops answering. **Uptime Kuma** is a self-hosted one.

**Intrusion detection.** Watching logs and system activity for signs of an attack. **CrowdSec** spots attacks such as brute force in logs and blocks the IPs; **Wazuh** also does *file integrity monitoring*, alerting when system files change.

---

## Email delivery

**Resend.** The service CKAuth sends its emails through.

**SPF.** A DNS record listing which servers may send email for a domain.

**DKIM.** A digital signature on each email, which proves the domain sent it and that nobody changed it.

**DMARC.** A DNS policy telling inboxes what to do with mail that fails SPF/DKIM: `none` (only report), `quarantine` (send to spam) or `reject`. `rua` is the address where daily reports go.

**Sender reputation / warming.** How much inbox providers trust a sending domain. New domains start with little trust, and *warming* builds it by sending slowly and cleanly at first.

---

## Search, speed and accessibility

**SEO (Search Engine Optimisation).** Making a site easy for search engines to find, understand and rank.

**Crawler.** A program that fetches pages for a search engine, such as Googlebot or Bingbot.

**Indexing.** A search engine storing a page so it can show it in results.

**robots.txt.** A file at the site's root that tells crawlers which paths not to fetch.

**Sitemap (`sitemap.xml`).** A list of the pages you want indexed.

**noindex / X-Robots-Tag.** An instruction not to show a page in search results. CKAuth sends it as a header on app screens.

**Canonical URL.** The one official address of a page, used when several URLs show the same content.

**Soft 404.** A page that says "not found" but returns status 200. Search engines treat it as low quality.

**Open Graph / Twitter card.** Tags that control the title, text and image shown when someone shares a link.

**Structured data (JSON-LD).** A machine-readable description of the page that search engines read, such as the site's name.

**Lighthouse.** Google's tool that scores a page from 0 to 100 on performance, accessibility, best practices and SEO.

**Core Web Vitals.** Google's measures of loading speed and stability:

| Metric | Measures | CKAuth's strict target |
|---|---|---|
| FCP (First Contentful Paint) | When anything first appears | 1.5 s |
| LCP (Largest Contentful Paint) | When the main content appears | 1.8 s |
| TBT (Total Blocking Time) | How long the page is too busy to respond | 50 ms |
| CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift) | How much the layout jumps around | 0.02 |

**Lab data vs field data (CrUX).** Lab data comes from a test run like Lighthouse. Field data is measured from real Chrome users; Google publishes it as CrUX, but only for sites with enough visitors.

**TTFB (Time To First Byte).** How long the server takes to start answering.

**CDN (Content Delivery Network).** Servers around the world that keep copies of a site close to its visitors, to cut the time requests travel.

**Backlink / referring domain.** A link to your site from another site. Each distinct linking site is a referring domain. Links are a major signal of trust for search engines.

**Search Console / Bing Webmaster Tools.** Free dashboards from Google and Bing that show how a site appears in search, with tools to submit sitemaps.

**IndexNow.** A protocol for telling Bing and others straight away that a page changed.

**WCAG / contrast ratio.** WCAG is the web accessibility standard. The contrast ratio compares text colour with its background; level AA needs at least 4.5:1 for normal text.
